                    Black mold, also known as Stachybotrys chartarum, is a fungus that can grow in damp and humid environments. It is commonly found in homes that have experienced water damage, such as leaks or floods, and can pose a severe health risk to those exposed to it.

                    </p><p>  
                        These include a musty or damp odor, discoloration on walls or ceilings, and black or green spots on surfaces. If you suspect black mold in your home, it's essential to have it professionally inspected to confirm its presence and determine the best course of action.
